"""Cadence policy for the ``/api/oauth/usage`` endpoint — every number in one place.

The endpoint enforces a per-access-token budget on non-first-party clients:
a **rolling ~60-minute window of ~28-30 requests per token × UA-class**
(measured 2026-07-11, probe3, two runs: a rested token admitted 30 requests
before the first 429; the post-drain 429 oscillation ended exactly when the
drain burst aged 60 minutes; steady 1/180 s polling then ran 96 minutes from
a rested window with zero 429s). It is NOT a bucket with a refill rate:
capacity returns only as old requests age out of the trailing hour, so a
burst saturates the token for up to a full hour — pausing does not restore
headroom early, and earlier "refill rate" estimates were artifacts of
measuring while saturated. Error bars: the horizon is bracketed to ~55-64
minutes from a single transition event, the exact edge algorithm (likely a
Cloudflare sliding-window approximation) is undocumented, and Anthropic can
retune it any day — so the constants below lean only on the robust parts:
a sustained rate safely under the cap, and an ~hour recovery horizon. The
budget target is an **average of at most ~1 request / 3 minutes per token**
(20/hour vs the ~28-30/hour cap), leaving ~8-10 requests/hour of headroom
for manual commands, wake-from-sleep catch-up, and the bounded urgent mode
below. Health invariant to watch in the logs: steady state shows zero
http-429, and any post-burst 429 clears within ≤60 minutes — an episode
outlasting an hour at modest rates means this model needs revisiting.

Plans computed here are persisted per account in the usage store
(``nextPollAt``/``pollIntervalS``) by whichever collector fetched, so every
surface — ``cswap list``, the TUI, the menu bar, the auto engine — inherits
the same cadence no matter how often it repaints.

If a future probe revises the measured shape, adjust the constants in this
module only.
